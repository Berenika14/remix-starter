              Originally from Kosovo, I moved to New York in 2017. Moving to the
              US at age 20 on my own, was the very first big step out of my
              comfort zone. A transition that helped me gain a global mindset,
              developed my cultural awareness and engraved the adaptability
              skill in me.

              In 2018 I started college in accounting and worked full time in
              the Hospitality industry simultaneously. Service industry work
              helped me evolve soft skills such as discipline, the ability to
              absorb criticism, and most important to read people like a book.
              Studying and working all together was challenging but thatâ€™s how I
              got very good at managing my time and achieving my daily goals.

            <p className="mt-6 opacity-50">
              A year ago I met my boyfriend and he is an Engineer. One day He
              left his laptop in front of me. I looked at his code, I got
              hypnotized and lost trying to figure out what it does. At that
              moment as someone who loves problem-solving, I knew I was going to
              learn to code. It was an instant click, and here comes the second
              big step in my life. I decided to drop out of college and started
              an intensive coding course at Bloomtech. BloomTech is a 6 months
              FullStack Web Development online course that prepared me for a
              career in the tech industry. I graduated from BloomTech on May
              2022 with experience of over 1000 hours of coding using Frontend
              and Backend tools such as React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Node.js,
              RESTful API, and more. I also had the opportunity to work on
              different projects with different teams which engraved my
              technical skills more and gave me the self-esteem to be able to
              work with different people.

              Looking back at how my life and my web development career
              unfolded, I see that most of it was a result of my beginner's
              mindset and curiosity. Curiosity about new places, new skills, and
              new opportunities.
              <br />
              Web development calls to my passions and I am ready and
              enthusiastic to collaborate and help companies succeed through my
              creativity, problem-solving and hard work.
